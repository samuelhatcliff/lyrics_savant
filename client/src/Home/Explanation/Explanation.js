optimistic vs pessimistic tone? Check "Compare two separate artists" to generate results for each artist that includes
charts comparing the number of unique words used and polarity data to acquire insights as to
how one might compare to another.`;

for the lyrics of your favorite niche artist. You can check to see if an artist is already included in our database
by typing their name into the search bar and seeing if they appear as a suggested result. If the artist does not appear
and you would like to generate data for this artist, click the "Contribute" tab in the navbar and enter the artist in the
search bar. Please be patient as the artist seeds to our database, as separate request are required to scrape lyrics for each
song.`
